I created a web map application of pavement markings assets using street segment ID for spatial reference for markings work. [Link to web application (Requires city account).](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=ec9b0e03be8344d2b35ba8119eeb2fca)

The purpose of this application is to look up and visualize completed pavement markings with install dates starting from May 1st, 2018 to present within the City of Austin's full jurisdiction boundaries. The markings asset navigator also includes the schedule for operational maintenance areas on a 2/4/8 year cycle.

Markings work include short line, long line, specialty markings, and raised pavement markings. The markings assets are an approximation of where markings exist based on plans submitted through various divisions within the Knack Data Tracker and Nearmap aerial imagery.
