## Process
Layout was probably the most time-intensive part of the project, which was surprising to me because I was under the assumption it was installation/paving of markings. I think going through the steps of layout really helped me understand the knowledge required in interpreting plans, MUTCD, understanding fractions/division, and coming up with standard procedure on the fly in cases where there are limitations in following plans on the field.

## Materials/Equipment
There was a lot more spray can use in layout than I thought. The use of the paint striper machine became straight forward after observing Steve, David and Carmen use of it. The flamethrower was intimidating since the fire is “invisible”. It was interesting using the preformed thermoplastic for the crosswalk and laying out similar to a stencil.

## Heat/Condition
The day we went out in the field there was a heat advisory in effect. Sunscreen, hats, and water were provided.

## Training/Value:
Going to the field was a fun experience. Steve, David , and Carmen were great teachers and a pleasure to work with. It really contextualizes how work orders are done in the data tracker.
