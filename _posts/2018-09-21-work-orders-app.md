I created a web map application of completed pavement markings work orders submitted through the data tracker. [Link to web application.](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a206bee097194382a00515a4cc9dd029)

The purpose of this application is to look up and visualize completed markings work orders from May 1st, 2018 to present within the City of Austin's full jurisdiction boundaries.

Markings work include short line, long line, specialty markings, and raised pavement markings. Work orders are assigned to work groups within the Signs and Markings division. The streets highlighted are an approximation of where work was completed by the Signs and Markings field crew based on plans submitted through various divisions within Austin Transportation Department and 3-1-1 CSR requests from citizens.
