This post will demonstrate how to create an excel file detailing the total number of assets, the total costs, and the annual costs.
[Here is the link to notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/susannegov/Signs-and-Markings-Projects/blob/master/Roadway Markings Analysis.ipynb)

These are the inputs required:

| Required | Description |
|:--------:|----|
| Markings  |Table of markings counts|
| Markings Costs |Table of costs for each markings asset|
| Roadways Table |List of TxDOT roadways affected|

The purpose is to calculate the total and annual costs of pavement markings of specific roadways if maintained by City of Austin.

This project would not have been completed without the help from:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to create dataframe of extracted table and transform the data
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to edit excel files including formulas and worksheets
- [arcgis](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/) to search for markings feature layer dataset
