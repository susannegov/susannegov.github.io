I am an Engineer Technician at the Austin Transportation Department. I enjoy analyzing data, designing graphics/layouts, and improving existing standard practices/procedures. I have taken engineering and GIS-related coursework, as well as gaining necessary work experience related to my field.

Under minimum supervision of a Professional Engineer, I perform a variety of moderately complex engineering projects/assignments that are non routine in nature and may deviate from standard practices, exercises judgment within defined methods and procedures in the Signs and Markings division at Austin Transportation Department.
