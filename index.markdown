I am an Engineer Technician at the Austin Transportation Department. As an undergrad I was an Environmental Studies major. I enjoy the multidisciplinary work of studying environmental scientific data and social issues that affect our daily lives. I have taken environmental and GIS-related coursework, as well as gaining necessary work experience related to my field. I hope to use the skills I learned from a variety of projects into good use.
